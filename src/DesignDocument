Basics:

Get user input for two sets of x and y using Scanner statements.
Parse out user response for x1, x2, y1, and y2 values
Print first and second coordinate points
calculate (in methods) and print the slope,distance, intercept, and line equation with those values
Use code below to round values for slope and y intercept
System.out.format("%.2f%n", variable)


Variables:
int x is the variable that we get from user for a y value in return
double y is the variable we output for the user's x value

private int x1
private int y1
private int x2
private int y2  these are all user input variables used to calculate slope, distance, and equation
private double z used for math to make sure there isn't any integer-integer math


Constructors:

Public Class LinearEquation(int x1 y1 x2 y2) {
 used to intialize instance variables and create new objects
}

Methods:

findY() use to parse out the Y value in the coordinates
findX() use to parse out the X value in the coordinates

findSlope() use to calculate and return the slope of any two points

findDistance() used to calculate return the distance between the two coordinate points given

findIntercept() calculates and returns Y intercept of the line

toString() returns a display of all the important info of the line in a nice, neat, and readable format. (slope distance...etc)



EquationRunner:

1. ask user for the two coordinates
2. parse through response and separate x1,x2,y1,y2 variables
3. declare a new object
3. run methods specifically toString to display info from other methods (findIntercept, findSlope, findDistance...etc) like the slope, equation, distance etc.
4 ask user for a x value
5 use finalEquation to calculate corresponding y value and print as a coordinate
